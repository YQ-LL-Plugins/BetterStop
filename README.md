# BetterStop

> A LiteLoaderBDS plugin to help you stop the server more safely

## Usage

Just install this plugin on your server.

After loaded, the "X" button at the top of console window will be banned, thus to avoid unexpected server shutdown. If you want to kill the server immediately, please use Ctrl+C.

And when `stop` command is detected, this plugin will kick all players out and then stop server safely.
